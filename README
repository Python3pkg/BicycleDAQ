BicycleDAQ

This a simple graphical user interface to collect data on an instrumented
bicycle. It connects to a National Instruments USB-6218 and to a VectorNav
VN-100 development board both through USB connections. It makes use of the
Matlab Data Aquistion Toolbox, NIDAQmx driver and the Matlab Serial interface.
It is intended to run on a netbook computer, in particular the ASUS Eee PC
1001P-MU17-WT.

Requirements (Probably not that strict)
------------
- Windows XP Pro
- Matlab (7.8.0 R2009a)
- VectorNav VN-100 http://www.vectornav.com
- VectorNav Matlab Library http://www.vectornav.com/downloads
- NI USB-6218 (or other similar device)

TODO
----
- Add in the LED light
- Display the data realtime
- Scaled data graphs
- If the trigger doesn't get pushed then have it break out of record mode
- Needs a cancel record function/button
- If you press connect, then record, then disconnect and try to close the gui, matlab crashes
- The handles.par parameters saved in the ConnectCallback are not being saved to file.
- save the time stamp to the runlist.txt in a better way
- When you load a data run, edit it and save, the runlist.txt doesn't get updated.
